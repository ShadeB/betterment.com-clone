        <h2>Bettement Everyday Savings</h2>

        <p>*The annual percentage yield ("APY") on the deposit balances in Betterment 
        Everyday Savings ("Savings") is 2.39% and represents the weighted average of 
        the APY on deposit balances at the banks participating in Savings (the 
        "Program Banks") and is current as of 08-13-2019. This APY is variable and 
        subject to change daily. Deposit balances are not allocated equally among the 
        participating Program Banks. A minimum deposit of $10 is required, but there 
        is no minimum balance required to be maintained. The APY cited above is a 
        promotional APY available only to customers who join the waiting list for 
        Betterment Everyday Checking. The APY on deposit balances of customers who 
        choose not to join the Betterment Everyday Checking waiting list is 0.25% less 
        than the promotional rate, and is 2.14% as of 08-13-2019, subject to change daily. 
        Betterment Securities will receive fees in connection with deposit balances earning 
        the non-promotional APY. See Current APY. The promotional APY is available through 
        the end of the year and may be extended in Betterment's sole discretion. The APY 
        available to a customer may be lower if that customer designates a bank or banks 
        as ineligible to receive deposits.</p>

        <p>See Betterment's Form ADV Part II and Terms and Conditions for additional 
        information on the deposit allocation methodology.</p>

        <p>See Betterment's Form ADV Part II and Terms and Conditions for 
        additional information on the deposit allocation methodology.</p>

        <p>†Betterment Everyday Savings ("Savings") is offered by Betterment 
        LLC. Clients of Betterment LLC may participate in Savings through their 
        brokerage account held at Betterment Securities. Neither Betterment LLC 
        nor any of its affiliates is a bank. Through Savings, clients' funds are 
        deposited into one or more banks ("Program Banks") where the funds earn 
        a variable interest rate and are eligible for FDIC insurance. Savings 
        provides Betterment clients with the opportunity to earn interest on 
        cash intended to purchase securities with through Betterment LLC and 
        Betterment Securities. Savings should not be viewed as a long-term 
        investment option.</p>

        <p>Funds held in brokerage accounts while in transit to Program Banks 
        are not eligible for FDIC insurance. Funds deposited into Savings are 
        eligible for up to $1,000,000.00 of FDIC insurance once the funds reach 
        one or more Program Banks (up to $250,000 each at up to four Program 
        Banks). Even if there are more than four Program Banks, clients will 
        not necessarily have deposits allocated in a manner that will provide 
        FDIC insurance above $1,000,000.00. The FDIC calculates the insurance 
        limits based on all accounts held in the same insurable capacity at a 
        bank, not just cash in Savings. If clients elect to exclude one or more 
        Program Banks from receiving deposits the amount of FDIC insurance 
        available through Savings may be lower. Clients are responsible for 
        monitoring their total assets at each Program Bank, including existing 
        deposits held at Program Banks outside of Savings, to ensure FDIC 
        insurance limits are not exceeded, which could result in some funds 
        being uninsured. For more information on FDIC insurance please visit 
        www.FDIC.gov. Deposits held in Program Banks are not protected by 
        SIPC. For more information see the full terms and conditions and 
        Betterment LLC’s Form ADV Part II</p>
